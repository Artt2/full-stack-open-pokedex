I am picking Java as the language for the hypothetical project. 
Linting is an automated process where the source code is checked for programmatic as well as stylistic errors. When it comes to linting, there are quite few options to consider, most popular ones being Checkstyle. Checkstyle has plugins for many IDEs, making it a good option for many. Lightrun is another popular choice, not actually a linter but a run-time debugger, helping raise bugs before serious run-time issues. Fullstack developers might consider using a single linter for all languages they are using (for the front- and backend), that is when PMD could come in handy.
One of the most common testing tools for Java is Junit, which is a unit testing tool and commonly used as a part of test-driven development. Mockito is another popular choice, a library/mocking framework that is mostly used for unit testing. It allows the user to add mock data and functionality.
One could use Jenkins X as opposed to Jenkins, which is a cloud-native version of Jenkins, but it is mainly used for Kuberenetes based apps. If youâ€™re working with the cloud, especially Azure, then Azure Pipelines might be a good choice for you. 
For a team of 6 that is working on an application, it is probably easiest to use a cloud-based service such as GitHub Actions for our application. It is going to be easy to setup and cheap, suiting well for our needs.
